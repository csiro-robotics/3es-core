  /// A utility class which generates a @c MtCollatedPacket message by appending multiple
  /// other messages. Compression may optionally be applied.
  ///
  /// Typical usage:
  /// - Instantiate the packet.
  /// - Reset the packet.
  /// - For each constituent message
  ///   - Generate the packet using @p PacketWriter.
  ///   - Finalise the message.
  ///   - Call @c add(const PacketWriter &)
  /// - Call @c finalise() on the collated packet.
  /// - Send the collated packet.
  /// - Call @c reset()
  ///
  /// The @c CollatedPacket also extends the @c Connection class in order to support
  /// multi-threaded packet generation and synchronisation. While the @c Connection
  /// and @c Connection implementations are required to be thread-safe, they
  /// cannot guarantee packets area correctly collated by thread. Thus a
  /// @c CollatedPacket can be used per thread to collate messages for each thread.
  /// The packet content can then be sent as a single transaction.
  ///
  /// By supporting the @c Connection methods, a @p CollatedPacket can be used in place
  /// of a 'server' argument with various server utility macros and functions.
  ///
  /// By default, a @c CollatedPacket has is limited to supporting @c MaxPacketSize bytes.
  /// This allows a single packet with a single @c PacketHeader and collated packet
  /// message with optional compression. However, when a collated packet is used for
  /// transaction collation (as described in the multi-threaded case), it may require
  /// collation of larger data sizes. In this case, the @c CollatedPacket(unsigned, unsigned)
  /// constructor can be used to specify a larger collation buffer limit (the buffer resizes as
  /// required). Such large, collated packets are sent using
  /// @c Server::send(const CollatedPacket &). Internally, the method may either send
  /// the packet as is (if small enough), or extract and reprocess each collated packet.
